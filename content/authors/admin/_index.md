I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of New Brunswick and a research member of the Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence (MAMCE). My research interests lie in the investigation of microstructure and corrosion behavior of metallic alloys, with a focus on alloys like 316L stainless steel and copper alloys such as Nickel Aluminum Bronze (NAB). I aim to optimize the mechanical strength and corrosion performance of industrial components fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques. By identifying effective pre- and post-processing methods, we can achieve an optimal balance between mechanical strength and reactivity in diverse working environments, leading to cost reduction and extended service life.
