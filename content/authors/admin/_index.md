I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of New Brunswick, where I am also a research member of the Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence (MAMCE). With my first Ph.D. in Materials Engineering from the University of Tabriz in Iran, my early research focused on analyzing the oxidation and corrosion behavior of YSZ coating on magnesium alloy using the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) technique. Building upon my expertise, I pursued a second Ph.D. at the University of New Brunswick, delving into the study of microstructural characterization and corrosion performance of a novel maraging stainless steel called CX stainless steel. I employed various microstructural characterization methods to analyze microstructural features. To complement my investigations, I utilized a range of electrochemical techniques such as EIS, potentiodynamic, and noise techniques to assess the corrosion behavior of this alloy fabricated by the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) technique. Moreover, I hold an M.Sc. degree in corrosion and protection of materials from Tarbiat Modares University in Iran. During this program, I conducted research on the stress corrosion cracking mechanism of pipeline steels, exploring the correlations among metallurgical aspects, failure analysis, and electrochemical reactions.
Currently, my research interests revolve around the investigation of microstructure, and corrosion behavior of various metallic alloys. Specifically, I focus on alloys like 316L stainless steel and copper alloys such as Nickel Aluminum Bronze (NAB). My primary goal is to identify the most effective pre- and post-processing techniques that can alter microstructural features to achieve an optimal balance between mechanical strength and reactivity in diverse working environments. By optimizing the mechanical strength and corrosion performance of industrial components fabricated using additive manufacturing, we can significantly reduce costs and extend their service life.
