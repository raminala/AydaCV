This research focused on the corrosion resistance and microstructure of hybrid additively manufactured (HAM) samples of AISI 420/ CX (420/CX SS) stainless steels. Potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Mottâ€“Schottky analyses as well as the electrochemical noise (EN) technique were used to evaluate the electrochemical behavior of the as-built and heat-treated HAM parts in NaCl solution. The results showed a more protective passive layer formed on the CX SS side. The distribution of Cr-rich M23C6 carbides in matrix of 420 SS side resulted in a lower corrosion resistance compared to the CX SS side.
The noise data analysis confirmed an increase in the galvanic currents of the HAM parts after heat treatment. The stochastic analysis revealed the interface in the heat-treated condition increases pit growth more than the as-built one due to the evolution of nanosized intermetallic compounds of Al-N/ (Cr, Nb) (N, C) at the heat-treated interface area.
